YoutubePlayer-in-WKWebView is forked from [youtube-ios-player-helper](https://github.com/youtube/youtube-ios-player-helper) For using WKWebView.

## Changes from [youtube-ios-player-helper](https://github.com/youtube/youtube-ios-player-helper)

- class prefix changed to WKYT from YT. `YTPlayerView` -> `WKYTPlayerView`
- using WKWebView instead of UIWebView.
- getting properties asynchronously.

```
	// YTPlayerView
	NSTimeInterval duration = self.playerView.duration;

	// WKYTPlayerView
    [self.playerView getDuration:^(NSTimeInterval duration, NSError * _Nullable error) {
        if (!error) {
            float seekToTime = duration * self.slider.value;
        }
    }];
```

```objc
    [self.playerView loadWithVideoId:@"M7lc1UVf-VE"];
